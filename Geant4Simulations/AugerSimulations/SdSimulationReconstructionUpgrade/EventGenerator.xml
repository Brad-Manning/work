<!-- In the EventGenerator tag we define the path and name of the schema file
     (EventGenerator.xsd) used to validate this xml file. When make is invoked,
     \@SCHEMALOCATION\@ gets replaced by the path to the directory in the install area
     where configuration files are copied. -->

  <!--
    The <eventIdentifier> is used to set the event ID for simulated
    events. The event ID is composed of 4 parts:
    1) libraryIdentifier (specified below). This can indicate purpose of
       the run, what computing center was used, or whatever the person
       in charge of productions feels is relevant
    2) A Run Id, which is read automatically from the shower file
    3) The Shower Id, which is read automatically from the shower file
    4) The number of times a given shower has been used by the event
       generator (in case, for example, one decides to throw the same
       shower in various positions on the array)
    The <format> tag below can be used to determine how the 4 components
    are arranged and decorated to form the event ID. You can use the usual printf
    directives in this <format> tag.

  <!-- Time stamp of the core impact on ground -->
